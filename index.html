            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my blog! I will document over time my projects in my career in the software developing.

            <h2>My first website</h2>
            <p>I thought on documenting my projects. I came to the decision on creating a blog on the world-wide-web.
            </p>
            <p>
                My primary objective was to obtain a domain and develop a website while keeping expenses at a minimum.
            </p>
            <div class="read-more-content">
                <p>After quite some researching, I came to the conclusion to launch the website on <a
                        style="color:rgb(202, 191, 248)" href="https://GitHub.com" class="hover-underline-animation">GitHub.com.</a> In order to do that is
                    a new repository  required. The name must be as follows: <i>'name'.github.io.</i></p>
                <p>I obtained my <b>marlonbitiq.com</b> domain from the website <a style="color:rgb(202, 191, 248)"
                        href="https://Squarespace.com" class="hover-underline-animation">Squarespace.com.</a> I initially looked for a Google domain, but
                    that changed due to Google stopping domain selling.</p>
                <p>I used Visual Studio Code to create my HTML and CSS scripts. It also enables me to submit my changes
                    directly to GitHub. I used YouTube and the internet to find answers and learn new skills.</p>

            <h2>3D game in Unity with C#</h2>
            <p>I decided to turn my school into a 3D game using Unity to improve my creative and
                technical skills.</p>
            <p>Despite facing difficulties, like losing the project and having to rebuild it, this experience showed my
                endurance.</p>
            <div class="read-more-content">
                <p>I navigated the complexities of 3D modeling and Unity programming, gaining skills like
                    importance of careful planning for future projects.</p>
                <p>In the end, this experience was not only rewarding but also set the foundation for my ongoing
                    exploration of programming and future projects.</p>

            <h2>Cisco Packet Tracer</h2>
            <p>Cisco Packet Tracer is a powerful tool to create network topologies and imitate modern computer networks.</p>
            <p>This section is intended to provide a brief overview of this topic:</p>
            <div class="read-more-content">
                <p>I first encountered this software in module at the vocational school, <a
                    style="color:rgb(202, 191, 248)" href="https://www.modulbaukasten.ch/module/129/3/de-DE?title=LAN-Komponenten-in-Betrieb-nehmen" class="hover-underline-animation">Module 129</a>. </p>
                    <p>It was an extremely interesting experience, allowing me to create a variety of networks and explore the vast potential of the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b style="font-size: 20px">Establish connection to different networks</b>
                </p> 
                <p>A simple network is illustrated here: </p>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="network_1.png" alt="Network" style="width: 900px; height: 400px;">
                </div>
                <p>All IP addresses and subnets have been correctly assigned. However, we are unable to ping the server from one of the PCs. The reason for this is that the router A is not aware of the existence of the network 192.168.2.0. 
                    <br>What we need require now is a so-called IP route or IP hop. This enables the router to be informed of the network ID.</p>
                <p>Once we have entered the router setting, we navigate to ROUTING -> Static. Here, we will need to enter the following IPs:</p>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="network_2.png" alt="Network" style="width: 600px; height: 150px;">
                </div>
                <p>Network: This is where we define the network ID that the router should be aware of.<br>
                    Mask: This is where we define the subnet mask of the network ID.<br>
                    Next Hop: This is where we tell the router A where the router is, that is able to redirect us to the network. In this instance, the appropiate router would be router B with the gateway address 192.168.3.2.

            <p>The Internet has come of age and everything is online. My hairdresser, who always does a perfect job, did not have a website to book a haircut.</p>
            <p>We worked together to create a functional <a class="hover-underline-animation" href="https://vkk.mhr.mybluehost.me/website_91454de2" style="color:rgb(202, 191, 248);" class="hover-underline-animation">Website</a> showing his location, prices and a booking function.</p>
